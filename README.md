# Universal Rename Tool 1.0.0

## Overview

It is an editor tool for Unity which allows you to replace object name parts with another values and works with multiple objects simultaneously.

## Example

You have a scene with hundreds of gameObjects with unique names and you need to rename part of them, e.g. with 'item' in name. Instead of changing all names ('item0', 'item1', etc) manually you can find them with Universal Rename Tool and replace 'item' with everything you want ('item\*' => 'instance\*').

## Features

* Search both in project & scenes
* Replace part of an object name with another part
* Ignore case option
* RegEx support
* Search in all scene or in particular object and its childs
* Optional match limitation

## Further improvements

* Add RegEx support in Project View search (custom panel with object selection is required)
